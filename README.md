#### AI learning from its ~~mistakes~~ wins and draws
Each board state is represented as a sequence of 0s, 1s and 2s, each element representing a tile with nothing, O or X, respectively. During gameplay, AI saves board states and moves it made. In case it wins or draws, the moves are saved and can be used the next time a certain board state is encountered. Otherwise, the moves are made randomly.

### FAQ
#### Is the name a homage to OXO?
No, though I wish it was.

#### Why make AI learn from its moves intstead of implementing one of strategies developed during the centuries of tic-tac-toe existance?
Seemed more fun and easier. I'm lazy that way.
